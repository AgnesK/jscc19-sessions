## coding challenges and pair programming
* challenge before? Could lead to people putting too much effort or people jumping off
* just send some code? Anything you have, you are proud of? Some people might not have something. Especially juniors
* pair programming on site. Katas? Real code if possible? 
* even a full day at the company with pay? Not always possible when having customers
* give feedback on challenges and interact with people to see how they react
* limit the technology and style or give the applicant free rein?
