# Babel Plugins

_Session facilitated by [Jake Runzer](https://github.com/coffee-cup)_.

## Agenda

- Went over what Babel is and how it is commonly used
- Went over JavaScript ASTs and what the Babel AST spec is. Looked at some links
  and tools to help understand and construct AST nodes.
- Created a simple babel plugin on ASTExplorer. Looked at what babel each
  visitor function receives as params.
- Explored plugin developed with TypeScript
- Looked at how we are using babel to transform simple React components to fully Redux
  connected components. If you are interested in trying out the alpha, please
  get in touch!


All of the resources and tools explored can be found in the
[babel-plugin-typescript-template](https://github.com/coffee-cup/babel-plugin-typescript-template)
repo.
