I shortly introduced what https://jskatas.org is and what it is good for.
I told that I added https://plausible.io stats lately and decided to ask people more, because I saw that (for my surprise) lots of people use the site (see stats here https://plausible.io/jskatas.org).

# Ideas where it coud go
- prevent from changing the assert line
- katas for react
- business katas for a company’s domain “problemkatas”
- showing the “required knowledge” for someone to learn X
- daily reminder to do a kata
- make it more transparent to allow contributions
- list “open for contributions” behind katas
- work together with a university to write katas
- collect stats about how many tests executed, how often tests are executed, how many passing/failing ones

# Thanks
Thank you for all participants throwing ideas around.
